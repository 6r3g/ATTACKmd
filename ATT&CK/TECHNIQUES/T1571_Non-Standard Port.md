# Non-Standard Port - T1571
---
## Description
[more on T1571](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1571)

Adversaries may communicate using a protocol and port paring that are typically not associated. For example, HTTPS over port 8088[1](https://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/elfin-apt33-espionage) or port 587[2](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/analysis-of-new-agent-tesla-spyware-variant.html) as opposed to the traditional port 443. Adversaries may make changes to the standard port used by a protocol to bypass filtering or muddle analysis/parsing of network data.
