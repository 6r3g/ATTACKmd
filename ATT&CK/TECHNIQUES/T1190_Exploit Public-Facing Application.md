# Exploit Public-Facing Application - T1190

## Description
[more on T1190](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190)

Adversaries may attempt to take advantage of a weakness in an Internet-facing computer or program using software, data, or commands in order to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior. The weakness in the system can be a bug, a glitch, or a design vulnerability. These applications are often websites, but can include databases (like SQL)[1](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-6662), standard services (like SMB[2](https://www.cisecurity.org/advisory/multiple-vulnerabilities-in-microsoft-windows-smb-server-could-allow-for-remote-code-execution/) or SSH), network device administration and management protocols (like SNMP and Smart Install[3](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-106A)[4](https://community.cisco.com/t5/security-blogs/attackers-continue-to-target-legacy-devices/ba-p/4169954)), and any other applications with Internet accessible open sockets, such as web servers and related services.[5](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-7169) Depending on the flaw being exploited this may include [[T1211_Exploitation for Defense Evasion|Exploitation for Defense Evasion (T1211)]].

If an application is hosted on cloud-based infrastructure and/or is containerized, then exploiting it may lead to compromise of the underlying instance or container. This can allow an adversary a path to access the cloud or container APIs, exploit container host access via [[T1611_Escape to Host|Escape to Host (T1611)]], or take advantage of weak identity and access management policies.

For websites and databases, the OWASP top 10 and CWE top 25 highlight the most common web-based vulnerabilities.[6](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project)[7](https://cwe.mitre.org/top25/index.html)
