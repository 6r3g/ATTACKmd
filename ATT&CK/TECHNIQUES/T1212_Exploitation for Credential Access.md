# Exploitation for Credential Access - T1212
---
## Description
[more on T1212](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1212)

Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities in an attempt to collect credentials. Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code.Â Credentialing and authentication mechanisms may be targeted for exploitation by adversaries as a means to gain access to useful credentials or circumvent the process to gain access to systems. One example of this is MS14-068, which targets Kerberos and can be used to forge Kerberos tickets using domain user permissions.[1](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms14-068.aspx)[2](https://adsecurity.org/?p=1515) Exploitation for credential access may also result in Privilege Escalation depending on the process targeted or credentials obtained.
