--- 
## Description

[more on T1590](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1590)

Adversaries may gather information about the victim's networks that can be used during targeting. Information about networks may include a variety of details, including administrative data (ex: IP ranges, domain names, etc.) as well as specifics regarding its topology and operations.

Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct collection actions via [[T1595_Active Scanning|Active Scanning (T1595)]] or [[T1598_Phishing for Information|Phishing for Information (T1598)]]. Information about networks may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex: [[T1596_Search Open Technical Databases|Search Open Technical Databases(T1596)]]).[1](https://www.whois.net/)[2](https://dnsdumpster.com/)[3](https://www.circl.lu/services/passive-dns/) Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: [[T1595_Active Scanning|Active Scanning (T1595)]] or [[T1593_Search Open Websites Domains|Search Open Websites/Domains (T1593)]]), establishing operational resources (ex: [[T1583_Acquire Infrastructure|Acquire Infrastructure (T1583)]] or [[T1584_Compromise Infrastructure|Compromise Infrastructure (T1584)]]), and/or initial access (ex: [[T1199_Trusted Relationship|Trusted Relationship (T1199)]]).
