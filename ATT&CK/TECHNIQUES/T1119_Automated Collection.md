Methods for performing this technique could include use of a [[T1059_Command and Scripting Interpreter|Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059)]] to search for and copy information fitting set criteria such as file type, location, or name at specific time intervals. This functionality could also be built into remote access tools.

This technique may incorporate use of other techniques such as [[T1083_File and Directory Discovery|File and Directory Discovery (T1083)]] and [[T1570_Lateral Tool Transfer|Lateral Tool Transfer (T1570)]] to identify and move files.
