# Gather Victim Host Information - T1592
---
## Description
[more on T1592](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1592)

Adversaries may gather information about the victim's hosts that can be used during targeting. Information about hosts may include a variety of details, including administrative data (ex: name, assigned IP, functionality, etc.) as well as specifics regarding its configuration (ex: operating system, language, etc.).

Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct collection actions via [[T1595_Active Scanning|Active Scanning (T1595)]] or [[T1598_Phishing for Information|Phishing for Information (T1598)]]. Adversaries may also compromise sites then include malicious content designed to collect host information from visitors.[1](https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/labs-research/scanbox-a-reconnaissance-framework-used-on-watering-hole-attacks) Information about hosts may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex: [[T1593_Search Open Websites Domains#Social Media - T1593 001|Social Media (T1593.001)]] or [[T1594_Search Victim-Owned Websites|Search Victim-Owned Websites (T1594)]]). Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: [[T1593_Search Open Websites Domains|Search Open Websites/Domains (T1593)]] or [[T1596_Search Open Technical Databases|Search Open Technical Databases(T1596)]]), establishing operational resources (ex: [[T1587_Develop Capabilities|Develop Capabilities (T1587)]] or [[T1588_Obtain Capabilities|Obtain Capabilities (T1588)]]), and/or initial access (ex: [[T1195_Supply Chain Compromise|Supply Chain Compromise (T1195)]] or [[T1133_External Remote Services|External Remote Services (T1133)]]).

## Sub-Techniques

#### Hardware - T1595.001
[more on T1592.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1592/001)

Adversaries may gather information about the victim's host hardware that can be used during targeting. Information about hardware infrastructure may include a variety of details such as types and versions on specific hosts, as well as the presence of additional components that might be indicative of added defensive protections (ex: card/biometric readers, dedicated encryption hardware, etc.).

Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct collection actions via [[T1595_Active Scanning|Active Scanning (T1595)]] (ex: hostnames, server banners, user agent strings) or [[T1598_Phishing for Information|Phishing for Information (T1598)]]. Adversaries may also compromise sites then include malicious content designed to collect host information from visitors.[1](https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/labs-research/scanbox-a-reconnaissance-framework-used-on-watering-hole-attacks) Information about the hardware infrastructure may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex: job postings, network maps, assessment reports, resumes, or purchase invoices). Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: [[T1593_Search Open Websites Domains|Search Open Websites/Domains (T1593)]] or [[T1596_Search Open Technical Databases|Search Open Technical Databases(T1596)]]), establishing operational resources (ex: [[T1587_Develop Capabilities|Develop Capabilities (T1587)]] or [[T1588_Obtain Capabilities|Obtain Capabilities (T1588)]]), and/or initial access (ex: [[T1195_Supply Chain Compromise#Compromise Hardware Supply Chain - T1195 003|Compromise Hardware Supply Chain (T1195.003)]] or [[T1200_Hardware Additions|Hardware Additions (T1200)]]).

#### Software - T1595.002
[more on T1592.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1592/002)

Adversaries may gather information about the victim's host software that can be used during targeting. Information about installed software may include a variety of details such as types and versions on specific hosts, as well as the presence of additional components that might be indicative of added defensive protections (ex: antivirus, SIEMs, etc.).

Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct collection actions via [[T1595_Active Scanning|Active Scanning (T1595)]] (ex: listening ports, server banners, user agent strings) or [[T1598_Phishing for Information|Phishing for Information (T1598)]]. Adversaries may also compromise sites then include malicious content designed to collect host information from visitors.[1](https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/labs-research/scanbox-a-reconnaissance-framework-used-on-watering-hole-attacks) Information about the installed software may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex: job postings, network maps, assessment reports, resumes, or purchase invoices). Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: [[T1593_Search Open Websites Domains|Search Open Websites/Domains (T1593)]] or [[T1596_Search Open Technical Databases|Search Open Technical Databases(T1596)]]), establishing operational resources (ex: [[T1587_Develop Capabilities|Develop Capabilities (T1587)]] or [[T1588_Obtain Capabilities|Obtain Capabilities (T1588)]]), and/or for initial access (ex: [[T1195_Supply Chain Compromise|Supply Chain Compromise (T1195)]] or [[T1133_External Remote Services|External Remote Services (T1133)]]).

#### Firmware - T1595.003
[more on T1592.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1592/003)

Adversaries may gather information about the victim's host firmware that can be used during targeting. Information about host firmware may include a variety of details such as type and versions on specific hosts, which may be used to infer more information about hosts in the environment (ex: configuration, purpose, age/patch level, etc.).

Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct elicitation via [[T1598_Phishing for Information|Phishing for Information (T1598)]]. Information about host firmware may only be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex: job postings, network maps, assessment reports, resumes, or purchase invoices).[1](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/08/intel-is-investigating-the-leak-of-20gb-of-its-source-code-and-private-data/) Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: [[T1593_Search Open Websites Domains|Search Open Websites/Domains (T1593)]] or [[T1596_Search Open Technical Databases|Search Open Technical Databases(T1596)]]), establishing operational resources (ex: [[T1587_Develop Capabilities|Develop Capabilities (T1587)]] or [[T1588_Obtain Capabilities|Obtain Capabilities (T1588)]]), and/or initial access (ex: [[T1195_Supply Chain Compromise|Supply Chain Compromise (T1195)]] or [[T1190_Exploit Public-Facing Application|Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1190)]]).
