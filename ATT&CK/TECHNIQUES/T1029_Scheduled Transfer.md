## Description
[more on T1029](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1029)

Adversaries may schedule data [[exfiltration]] to be performed only at certain times of day or at certain intervals. This could be done to blend traffic patterns with normal activity or availability.

When scheduled [[exfiltration]] is used, other [[exfiltration]] techniques likely apply as well to transfer the information out of the network, such as [[T1041_Exfiltration Over C2 Channel|Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041)]] or [[T1048_Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol|Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol (T1048)]].
