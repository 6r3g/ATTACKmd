## Description
[more on T1200](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1200)

Adversaries may introduce computer accessories, computers, or networking hardware into a system or network that can be used as a vector to gain access. While public references of usage by threat actors are scarce, many red teams/penetration testers leverage hardware additions for initial access. Commercial and open source products can be leveraged with capabilities such as passive network tapping [1](https://ossmann.blogspot.com/2011/02/throwing-star-lan-tap.html), network traffic modification (i.e. [[T1557_Adversary-in-the-Middle|Adversary-in-the-Middle (T1557)]]) [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvf4ScWbcQ), keystroke injection [3](https://www.hak5.org/blog/main-blog/stealing-files-with-the-usb-rubber-ducky-usb-exfiltration-explained), kernel memory reading via DMA [4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXthwl6ShOg), addition of new wireless access to an existing network [5](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/03/the-pwn-plug-is-a-little-white-box-that-can-hack-your-network/), and others.
