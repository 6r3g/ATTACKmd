# ATTACKmd
Mitre att&amp;ck framework tactics and techniques in markdown format for best use in Obsidian.

## Goal
Have a markdown and offline version of the framework, while keeping the links between tactics, techniques and sub-techniques.

## Design
One file per tactic and one file per technique (with sub-techniques), reproduced as on the Miter ATT&CK website but replacing the original links with internal links such as wikilinks [[ ]].
Each has a "read more on Txxxx" link for quick access to the online version.
I do not include the "software" and "mitigations" part which have less interest in my PKB project, the references to these elements therefore remain external links.

## Use cases
Personally, I use it as an immutable referential (no enrichment or interpretation) that I quote and use in other notes in my Obsidian vault.
As a bonus, the graphic view which allows to have a macro view of the links between tactics and techniques which I find quite satisfying to watch and analyze.

In progress...
