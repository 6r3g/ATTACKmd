## Description
[more on T1594](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1594)

Adversaries may search websites owned by the victim for information that can be used during targeting. Victim-owned websites may contain a variety of details, including names of departments/divisions, physical locations, and data about key employees such as names, roles, and contact info (ex: [[T1589_Gather Victim Identity Information#Email Addresses - T1589 002|Email Addresses (T1589.002)]]). These sites may also have details highlighting business operations and relationships.[1](https://www.comparitech.com/blog/vpn-privacy/350-million-customer-records-exposed-online/)

Adversaries may search victim-owned websites to gather actionable information. Information from these sources may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: [[T1598_Phishing for Information|Phishing for Information (T1598)]] or [[T1596_Search Open Technical Databases|Search Open Technical Databases (T1596)]]), establishing operational resources (ex: [[T1585_Establish Accounts|Establish Accounts (T1585)]] or [[T1586_Compromise Accounts|Compromise Accounts (T1586)]]), and/or initial access (ex: [[T1199_Trusted Relationship|Trusted Relationship (T1199)]] or [[T1566_Phishing|Phishing (T1566)]]).
