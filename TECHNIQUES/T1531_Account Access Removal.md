## Description
[more on T1531](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1531)

Adversaries may interrupt availability of system and network resources by inhibiting access to accounts utilized by legitimate users. Accounts may be deleted, locked, or manipulated (ex: changed credentials) to remove access to accounts.

Adversaries may also subsequently log off and/or reboot boxes to set malicious changes into place.[1](https://www.carbonblack.com/2019/03/22/tau-threat-intelligence-notification-lockergoga-ransomware/)[2](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/born-this-way-origins-of-lockergoga/)
