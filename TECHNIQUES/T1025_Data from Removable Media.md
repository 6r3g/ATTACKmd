---
## Description
[more on T1025](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1025)

Adversaries may search connected removable media on computers they have compromised to find files of interest. Sensitive data can be collected from any removable media (optical disk drive, USB memory, etc.) connected to the compromised system prior to [[Exfiltration]]. Interactive command shells may be in use, and common functionality within [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106) may be used to gather information.

Some adversaries may also use [[T1119_Automated Collection|Automated Collection (T1119)]] on removable media.
