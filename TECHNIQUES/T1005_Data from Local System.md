## Description
[more on T1005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1005)

Adversaries may search local system sources, such as file systems or local databases, to find files of interest and sensitive data prior to [[Exfiltration]].

Adversaries may do this using a [[T1059_Command and Scripting Interpreter|Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059)]], such as [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106), which has functionality to interact with the file system to gather information. Some adversaries may also use [[T1119_Automated Collection|Automated Collection (T1119)]] on the local system.
